# Understanding Delayed Discharges and Bed Occupancy Pressures at James Paget University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust 
## 1. Executive Summary 
James Paget University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust (hereafter referred to as ‘James Paget’) has experienced pressures in delayed discharges. This report analyses these trends and their implications for healthcare and social care services. It aims to guide ICB teams and stakeholders in strategic planning, highlighting the necessity of adapting healthcare services and policies in response to increases in delayed discharges. The analysis uses NHS England delayed discharges data (September 2023–April 2025) and bed availability and occupancy data (January 2011–June 2024).
With the work developed in this report, we found several key findings. First, it was found that James Paget has consistently faced challenges in discharging patients who are medically fit to leave the hospital. Second, the main contributor to bed days lost after discharge-ready date has been patients experiencing long delays of more than 21 days. Third, the average days from discharge-ready date to discharge has been increasing to levels above the national average. Fourth, delays linked to hospital, interface and care-transfer hub processes are the leading causes of delayed discharge at James Paget. 
Delayed discharges at James Paget represent a key operational issue that directly affects patient flow. The high percentage of patients experiencing long delays indicate that systemic barriers go far beyond day-to-day operational inefficiencies and significantly affect total bed days lost. The increase of the average number of days from discharge-ready date to discharge signals the importance of targeted local strategies, data-driven monitoring, and collaboration between hospitals, NHS planners, care homes, and local authorities. The dispersion of delay reasons across interface processes, hospital processes, and care-transfer hub highlights the importance of an integrated discharge planning system across all social and health care, as bottlenecks in one part of the system can create cascading effects that prolong hospital stays and impact patient flow elsewhere in the system.
Based on the findings of this report, several next steps should be considered. First, a joint discharge taskforce should be created. Second, a real-time dashboard should be developed to track discharge-ready patients, reasons for delay, and average delays. Third, implement a digital referral and tracking system to improve the communication between hospital discharge teams, care homes, and local authorities. Fourth, perform a local market analysis of care-home capacity, placement delays, and bed and workforce availability. Fifth, increase weekend discharge capacity. Lastly, complement quantitative analysis with staff, patient and focus groups interviews.

## 2. Data & Findings
### 2.1- Overall Discharge Challenges
James Paget has consistently faced challenges discharging patients who are medically fit to leave. From July 2024 to March 2025, between 2000 and 3000 patients a day remained in hospital despite no longer meeting the criteria to reside. This is a considerable proportion of the total 3500-4500 patients a day identified as no longer meeting the criteria to reside. On average, each day, the number of patients discharged was lower than the number of patients remaining in the hospital.

### 2.2-Nature of Discharge Delays 
At James Paget, the largest driver of bed days lost after the discharge-ready date was patients experiencing long delays of more than 21 days. These long delays increased considerably over 2024–25 and accounted for a large proportion of bed days lost in the entire period analyzed. Minor delays, from 1, 2 to 3, 4 to 6, 7 to 13 and 14 to 20 represented a lower proportion of the total days lost.

At James Paget, the average days from discharge-ready date to discharge has been increasing to levels above the national average. In February 2024, the average was 4.8 days at James Paget and 6.3 days nationally. By February 2025, the average had risen to 8.1 days at James Paget, while the national average had decreased to 6.1 days.

### 2.3- Reasons for Delayed Discharges
Hospital process delays are the most common reason for delayed discharge at James Paget. The latest data collection system, launched in May 2024, requires discharge hubs and wards to classify discharges into one of the following categories:
•	Hospital process (delays related to issues within the hospital’s control, for example medication or transport)
•	Wellbeing concerns (delays related to issues outside of the hospital’s control, such as awaiting determination of mental capacity)
•	Care-transfer hub process (for example, the most common situation is where the patient’s immediate care needs and pathway have not yet been determined)
•	Interface process (where transfer is in progress but not yet been finalized)
•	Capacity (where the required service for the patient is not yet accessible)
With the exception of hospital process, all categories involve delays attributed to both the NHS and social care. From June 2024 to April 2025, patients with lengths of stays of at least 14 days at James Paget collectively experienced 22,582 patient-days of delay. The main cause was interface process (7,587 patient-days), followed by hospital process (7,346), care-transfer hub process (6,030), capacity (2,878), and wellbeing concerns (1,441).

If we focus on the patient-day delays attributed to interface process issues, the main reason within this category is that residential or nursing home care arrangements are still underway (3,120 patient-days). Within the hospital process category, the main reason is awaiting therapy review to assess the need for supported discharge (3,823 patient-days). Among the patient-days delays attributed to care-transfer hub process issues, the main reason is awaiting confirmation of immediate care needs and pathway (5,178 patient-days).

### 2.4- Bed Occupancy Context
Although there is no agreed standard for bed occupancy rates, NHS operational planning guidelines set the maximum threshold at 92%. The bed occupancy rate at James Paget has consistently been below 92% over the past few years. During the pandemic, bed occupancy fell considerably; however, the NHS stated that hospitals experienced bed pressures even with low occupancy levels due to infection control and other measures to monitor how beds and staff were managed. The bed occupancy rate returned to pre-pandemic levels at the end of 2022.

## 3. Discussion & Implications
### 3.1 Persistent Discharge Delays and Systemic Pressures
James Paget has had persistent challenges in discharging patients who are clinically ready to leave. Despite a national effort to improve patient flow and delayed discharges, between July 2024 and March 2025, between 2,000 and 3,000 patients at James Paget each day remained in the hospital despite being medically fit to leave. This figure represents a high proportion of the total discharged patients who no longer meet the criteria to remain in the hospital. 
These findings indicate that delayed discharges at James Paget are a key operational issue that directly affects patient flow, bed availability and emergency department congestion. Delayed discharges not only increase pressure on hospital capacity but can also lead to poorer patient outcomes, including loss of independence due to reduced mobility and confidence after discharge.
### 3.2 - Nature and Duration of Delays
Long delays of more than 21 days are the main drivers of lost bed days at James Paget. These long delays increased between February 2024 and January 2025 and represent now a high proportion of the total bed days lost after the discharge-ready date. This suggests that systemic barriers that go far beyond day-to-day operational inefficiencies significantly affect total bed days discharges. 
Minor delays, ranging from 1 to 6 days, represent a relatively small percentage of the total bed days lost, indicating that operational improvements in discharge process routines will not be sufficient to solve the problem, as they may not address the root cause.
In addition, the increase of the average days from discharge-ready date to discharge from 4.8 days to 8.1 at James Paget – exceeding the national average – indicates that the discharge efficiency is deteriorating. These increases at James Paget signals the importance of targeted local strategies, data-driven monitoring, and collaboration between hospitals, NHS planners, community providers, and local authorities.

### 3.3- Causes of Delay and Cross-System Dependencies
Hospital and interface process delays are the most common reason for delayed discharge at James Paget. Patients with a length of stay of 14 days or over who no longer meet the criteria to reside collectively experienced 7,587 patient-days of delay due to interface process issues, 7,346 due to hospital process issues and 6,030 due to care-transfer hub process-related delays. This distribution highlights the importance of an integrated discharge planning across all social and health care, as bottlenecks in one part of the system can create cascading effects that prolong hospital stays and impact patient flow elsewhere in the system.
The high number of delays related with interface and care-transfer hub processes suggests that joint accountability mechanisms involving hospitals and local care providers are needed to understand and address the root causes of the delayed discharges. The large number of cases awaiting confirmation of immediate care needs and pathway shows the complexity of decision-making in determining whether the patient requires residential care, home care, or reablement. The lack of standardized, joint assessment tools or real-time information between hospitals and social care exacerbates this problem. 
Awaiting therapy review to assess the need for supported discharge is the second biggest reason for delayed discharges. Therapy assessments are essential for safe discharge plans; however, these assessments can be delayed due to staff shortages, low weekend cover or other clinical priorities. This highlights the importance to prioritize the planning of discharge assessments earlier in the patient journey and expand the availability of the workforce in a way that allows a seven-day discharge planning.  
Delays due to residential or nursing home care arrangements still underway are also one of the main reasons of delayed discharges, reflecting the growing dependence on community and social care capacity for effective discharge planning. This reflects the limited availability of care home placements. In many cases even when the patient is medically ready, securing home care placement can take weeks, due to the coordination that is needed between hospitals, care home providers, local authorities and patient families. This plays a big factor in prolonging hospital stays, increases costs and reduce the system performance and responsiveness.  
### 3.4- Capacity delays 
High values of bed occupancy rates make the process difficult to find beds for patients, impacting the operational performance, patient flow and waiting times. At James Paget, over the past years, bed occupancy rate has consistently been below the maximum threshold of 92% set by NHS guidelines. However, it is important to consider that factors such as infection prevention measures, workforce shortages, and patient acuity can reduce the effective capacity when the occupancy rates appear to be within the target levels. This situation was particularly evident during the COVID-19 pandemic.
## 4. Conclusion & Next Steps
The analysis on this report found several key findings. First, the report found that James Paget has consistently faced challenges in discharging patients who are medically fit to leave the hospital. Second, the largest contributor to bed days lost after discharge-ready date has been patients experiencing long delays of more than 21 days. Third, hospital process-related delays represent the leading cause of delayed discharge at James Paget, with the main reason within this category being that residential or nursing home placements are still being arranged. Awaiting therapy review to assess the need for supported discharge and awaiting confirmation of immediate care needs and pathway are also the top reasons for delayed discharges. Lastly, over the past few years bed occupancy rates at James Paget have consistently remained below the NHS guidelines threshold of 92%. 
As with all reports, this has several important limitations. First, the delayed discharges reasons data were obtained from monthly reports that represent daily averages based on one-day weekly snapshot. To estimate the total number of patient-days delayed, these daily averages were multiplied by the number of days in each month and then summed across the analysed period. This approach delivers an approximation indication of the scale of delays, however it can slightly overestimate the totals, as the same patient can appear in more than one daily snapshot. For this reason, the figures on delayed discharge reason (point 2.3 in the Data & Findings section) should be interpreted as indicative estimates and not as exact counts. Second, the report is descriptive and does not control for confounding variables such as seasonal variation, hospital case mix, staffing levels, or community care capacity that may have effects on discharge performance. Third, the analysis is based on a single trust, and for that reason the findings may not generalise to other trusts with different demographic or operational characteristics. 
Notwithstanding these limitations, this study has key strengths. First, this report integrates multiple data sources. It uses a data pipeline to ingest, process, transform and store multiple CSV files originating from different reports, such as the Acute Discharge Situation Report, Discharge-Ready Date Report and Bed Availability and Occupancy Data, spanning across multiple months. Second, by linking data across multiple monthly reports, the performed analysis allows the identification of trends, bottlenecks, and seasonal fluctuations that otherwise would not be visible in short-term analysis. Third, the report combines descriptive analysis with contextual interpretation showing how hospital operations, processes, workforce capacity, and social care can affect patient flow and delayed discharges. Lastly, this report contributes with local actionable insights that can be used to create intelligence that supports decisions on patient discharges and bed utilisation policies. 
Based on the findings of this study, several next steps should be considered. First, a joint discharge taskforce should be created to strengthen coordination between hospital operations, therapy teams, local authorities, and social care in order to review pathways and unblock delays. The goal should be to reduce the number of patients waiting more than 14 days after being declared ready for discharge. Second, a real time dashboard should be developed to monitor discharge-ready patients, reasons for delay, and averages days delayed in real time. This would allow the identification of bottlenecks early in the process of discharge and improve accountability across wards. Third, implement a digital referral and tracking system to improve the communication between hospital discharge teams, care homes, and local authorities. This would improve communication between hospitals and care homes, reduce deduplications, and increase visibility of available care-home vacancies. Fourth, perform local market analysis in care-home capacity, placement delays, and bed and workforce availability. Collaborate with the ICB to plan medium- and long-term strategies to address the capacity gaps in care homes. Fifth, explore the possibility to increase discharge capacity over the weekends. Better weekend discharge coordination can reduce the average length of stay and help avoid Monday bottlenecks in bed occupancy. Lastly, complement quantitative data with staff, patient and focus group interviews to understand local factors that may affect discharge times, such as communication, documentation practices, or care coordination.
