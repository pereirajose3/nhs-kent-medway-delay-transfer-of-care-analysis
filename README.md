# NHS Norfolk and Waveney ICB Delayed Transfer of Care Analysis

Analyzing delayed transfers of care (DTOC) in NHS Kent & Medway ICB to identify trends and improvement opportunities.

## Project Overview 

This project investigates Delayed Transfers of Care (DTOC) in the Kent & Medway Integrated Care Board (ICB). DTOC occurs when patients remain in hospital after being assessed as medically fit for discharge.

The analysis covers:
- Monthly DTOC trends
- Analysis across NHS trusts, Integrated Care Boards (ICBs), and national level.
- Assessment of system-level factors contributing to delays
- Visual tools to identify trends

The goal is to support the local ICB planning team by highlighting pressure points.

## Objectives

- Analyze historical DTOC data for Kent & Medway ICB
- Highlight time trends and variations at the national, ICB, and trust levels.
- Identify frequent reasons and patterns behind DTOC
- Provide actionable insights for care coordination and policy improvement

## Tools & Data Sources

- **Language:** SQL and Python with pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, plotly and pandas  
- **Data Sources:** NHS England DTOC statistics data
