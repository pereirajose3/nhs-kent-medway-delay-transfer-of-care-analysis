# NHS Kent & Medway Delayed Transfer of Care Analysis

Analyzing delayed transfers of care (DTOC) in NHS Kent & Medway to identify trends and improvement opportunities.

## Project Overview

This project investigates Delayed Transfers of Care (DTOC) in the Kent & Medway Integrated Care System (ICS). DTOC occurs when patients remain in hospital after being deemed medically fit for discharge, often due to nonâ€‘clinical factors like social care or care home placement delays.

The analysis covers:
- Daily and monthly DTOC trends
- Comparison across NHS trusts and discharge reasons
- Assessment of system-level factors contributing to delays
- Visual tools to identify bottlenecks

The goal is to support local health and social care planning by spotlighting pressure points and resource needs.

## Objectives

- Analyze historical DTOC data for Kent & Medway ICS
- Highlight time trends, regional variation, and trust-specific issues
- Identify frequent reasons and patterns behind care delays
- Provide actionable insights for care coordination and policy improvement

## Tools & Data Sources

- **Language:** Python with libraries like pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, geopandas
- **Data Sources:** NHS England DTOC statistics (Integrated Discharge Dataset), Kent & Medway ICS reports, ONS demographic context
- **Notebooks:** Jupyter Notebooks for data prep, analysis, and visualization
