# Understanding Delayed Discharges and Bed Occupancy Pressures at Norfolk and Norwich University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust 
## 1. Executive Summary 
Norfolk and Norwich University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust (hereafter referred to as ‘Norfolk and Norwich’) has experienced pressures in delayed discharges. This report analyses these trends and their implications for healthcare and social care services. It aims to guide ICB teams and stakeholders in strategic planning, highlighting the necessity of adapting healthcare services and policies in response to increases in delayed discharges. The analysis uses NHS England delayed discharges data (September 2023–April 2025) and bed availability and occupancy data (January 2011–June 2024).

With the work developed in this report, we found several key findings. First, it was found that Norfolk and Norwich have faced challenges in discharging patients who are medically fit to leave the hospital. Second, the main contributor to bed days lost after discharge-ready date has been patients experiencing long delays of more than 21 days. Third, capacity-related delays represent the leading cause of delayed discharge at Norfolk and Norwich, with the main reason being that bed-based rehabilitation, reablement or recovery services are not yet available. Fourth, since mid-2023 bed occupancy rates at Norfolk and Norwich have consistently surpassed the NHS guidelines threshold of 92%.

Based on the findings of this report, several next steps should be considered. First, a joint discharge taskforce should be created. Second, a real-time dashboard should be developed to track discharge-ready patients, reasons for delay, and average delays. Third, community and social-care capacity should be increased. Third, a digital referral and tracking system should implemented to improve the communication between hospital discharge teams, care homes, and local authorities. Fourth, operational improvements such as increasing transport availability at peak discharge hours, creating daily targets for medical reviews, and using a digital tracking system to monitor discharge-related processes should be adopted. Fifth, quantitative analysis should be complemented with staff, patient, and focus-group interviews.


## 2. Data & Findings
### 2.1- Overall Discharge Challenges
At Norfolk and Norwich University Hospitals, most patients who no longer met the criteria to reside were discharged promptly. From June 2024 to March 2025, between 1,000 and 1,300 patients per day on average remained in hospital despite no longer meeting the criteria to reside, with a seasonal spike in December 2024 when the number rose to around 1,900 patients (Figure 1). Although this is a substantial number, this represents a relatively small proportion of the total 5,000 to 6,000 patients a day identified as no longer meeting the criteria to reside during the same period.

### 2.2-Nature of Discharge Delays 
At Norfolk and Norwich University Hospitals, the largest driver of bed days lost after the discharge-ready date was patients experiencing long delays of more than 21 days. These long delays accounted for a large proportion of bed days lost in the entire period. Delays of 14-20 days and 7-13 days also contributed to a considerable portion of bed days lost, forming the second-largest groups. Shorter delays, —1 day, 2-3 days and 4-6 days—represented a smaller proportion of the total days lost (Figure 2).

At Norfolk and Norwich University Hospitals, the average days from discharge-ready date to discharge has been decreasing and has remained below the national average. In February 2024, the average was 5.9 days at Norfolk and Norwich and 6.3 days nationally. By February 2025, the average had fallen to 4.8 days at Norfolk and Norwich and slightly decreased to 6.1 days nationally (Figure 3).

### 2.3- Reasons for Delayed Discharges
Capacity delays are the most common reason for delayed discharge at Norfolk and Norwich University Hospitals. The latest data collection system, launched in May 2024, requires discharge hubs and wards to classify discharges into one of the following categories:
•	Hospital process (delays related to issues within the hospital’s control, for example medication or transport)

•	Wellbeing concerns (delays related to issues outside of the hospital’s control, such as awaiting determination of mental capacity)

•	Care-transfer hub process (for example, the most common situation is where the patient’s immediate care needs and pathway have not yet been determined)

•	Interface process (where transfer is in progress but not yet been finalized)

•	Capacity (where the required service for the patient is not yet accessible)

With the exception of hospital process, all delays categories involve contributions from both the NHS and social care. From June 2024 to April 2025, patients at Norfolk and Norwich with lengths of stays of at least 14 days collectively experienced 33,705 patient-days of delay. The main cause was capacity (16,374 patient-days), followed by hospital process (10,829), care-transfer hub process (2,974), interface process (2,587), and wellbeing concerns (941) (Figure 4).

If we focus on the patient-day delays attributed to capacity issues, the main reason within this category is that bed-based rehabilitation, reablement or recovery services not yet available (9,969 patient-days) (Figure 5). Within the hospital process category, the largest contributor is awaiting patient transport services (2,796 patient-days) , followed by awaiting medical review of need for supported discharge, awaiting referral to care transfer hub for supported discharge and awaiting formal discission to discharge. (Figure 6).

### 2.4- Bed Occupancy Context
Although there is no agreed standard for bed occupancy rates, NHS operational planning guidelines set the maximum threshold at 92%. The bed occupancy rate at Norfolk and Norwich University Hospitals remained between 86-93% from 2011to early 2020 (Figure 7). During the pandemic, bed occupancy fell considerably; however, the NHS stated that hospitals experienced bed pressures even with low occupancy levels due to infection-control and additional operational measures related to the management of beds and staff. The bed occupancy rate returned to pre-pandemic levels at the end of 2021 and has since increased, surpassing the NHS 92% threshold in late 2023.

## 3. Discussion & Implications
### 3.1 Discharge Delays
The analysis on the discharge delays indicates that Norfolk and Norwich University Hospitals face challenges in discharging patients who no longer meet the criteria to reside. The average daily number of patients remaining in hospital despite not meeting the criteria to reside ranges from 1,000 to 1,900, placing sustained pressure on bed availability. The spike observed in December 2024 reflects the seasonal pressures that normally occur during the winter months, when the hospital demand increases and bed capacity is often most constrained. 

Despite the high numbers, these delayed discharges represent a small proportion of the patients who no longer meet the criteria to remain in the hospital and are discharged on time. This suggests that the issue is not only driven by delayed-discharge operations but also reflects a broader system-level imbalance between social and healthcare demand and the services needed to provide a safe and on-time discharge. 

### 3.2.	Nature and Duration of Delays
Long delays of more than 21 days are the main drivers of lost bed days at Norfolk and Norwich. These long delays represent a high proportion of the total bed days lost after the discharge-ready date. This suggests that systemic barriers that go far beyond day-to-day operational inefficiencies significantly affect overall delayed-discharge bed days. 

Minor delays, ranging from 1 to 6 days, represent a relatively small percentage of the total bed days lost, indicating that operational improvements in discharge process routines will not be sufficient to solve the problem, as they may not address the root cause.

The average number of days from discharge-ready date to actual discharge decreased from 5.9 to 4.8 days at Norfolk and Norwich, remaining well below the national average of 6.1 days. This suggests that operational discharge processes have become more efficient. However, the high volume of long delays caused by limited social and healthcare capacity still offsets the gains achieved with these operational improvements. This signals the importance of targeted local strategies, data-driven monitoring, and collaboration between hospitals, NHS planners, community providers, and local authorities.

### 3.3.	Causes of Delay and Cross-System Dependencies
Capacity and Hospital processes are the most common reason for delayed discharges at Norfolk and Norwich. From June 2024 to April 2025, patients with a length of stay of 14 days or over who no longer meet the criteria to reside collectively experienced 16,374 patient-days of delay due to capacity issues and 10,829 due to hospital process-related delays. 

The high number of delays related to capacity suggest a structural shortage of community and social-care capacity in the local area. These services operate at or beyond full utilisation, causing patients who are medically fit for discharge to remain in hospital. This causes long delays that significantly increase the total number of bed days lost due to delay discharges. 

Hospital process is the second biggest reason for delayed discharges indicating that internal operations constraints also play a significant role. These delays are due to issues such as waiting patient transport services, awaiting medical review of need for supported discharge, awaiting referral to care-transfer hub for supported discharge and awaiting formal decision to discharge. Hospital-process delays tend to be shorter in time, but their frequency makes them a substantial contributor to the total bed-days lost.  

These findings demonstrate that delayed discharge is not caused by a single organisation but by the complex interaction of services between hospital processes, community care availability, and social-care capacity. Robust and significant improvements can only be achieved when these issues are improved and strengthened together.

### 3.4.	Bed Capacity
High bed occupancy rates make it difficult to find available beds for patients, impacting operational performance, patient flow and waiting times. At Norfolk and Norwich, over the past 14 years, the bed occupancy rate has occasionally surpassed the maximum threshold of 92% set by NHS guidelines. Since mid-2023, it has consistently surpassed this threshold, reaching a peak of 95%. High bed occupancy levels have impact on the hospital’s ability to manage emergency demand, respond to seasonal fluctuations, and maintain normal patient flow.

Bed occupancy temporarily decreased during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, it is also important to consider that factors such as infection prevention measures, workforce shortages, and patient acuity can reduce the effective capacity when the occupancy rates appear to be within the target levels. This situation was particularly evident during the COVID-19 pandemic.

# 4.	Conclusion & Next Steps
The analysis on this report found several key findings. First, the report found that Norfolk and Norwich have consistently faced challenges in discharging patients who are medically fit to leave the hospital. Second, the largest contributor to bed days lost after discharge-ready date has been patients experiencing long delays of more than 21 days. Third, capacity-related delays represent the leading cause of delayed discharge at Norfolk and Norwich, with the main reason being that bed-based rehabilitation, reablement or recovery services are not yet available. The second main cause is hospital-process-related delays, including waiting for patient transport services, awaiting medical review of need for supported discharge, awaiting referral to care-transfer hub and awaiting a formal decision to discharge. Lastly, since mid-2023 bed occupancy rates at Norfolk and Norwich have consistently surpassed the NHS guidelines threshold of 92%.

As with all reports, this has several important limitations. First, the delayed discharges reasons data were obtained from monthly reports that represent daily averages based on one-day weekly snapshot. To estimate the total number of patient-days delayed, these daily averages were multiplied by the number of days in each month and then summed across the analysed period. This approach delivers an approximation indication of the scale of delays, however it can slightly overestimate the totals, as the same patient can appear in more than one daily snapshot. For this reason, the figures on delayed discharge reason (point 2.3 in the Data & Findings section) should be interpreted as indicative estimates and not as exact counts. Second, the report is descriptive and does not control for confounding variables such as seasonal variation, hospital case mix, staffing levels, or community care capacity that may have effects on discharge performance. Third, the analysis is based on a single trust, and for that reason the findings may not generalise to other trusts with different demographic or operational characteristics.

Notwithstanding these limitations, this study has key strengths. First, this report integrates multiple data sources. It uses a data pipeline to ingest, process, transform and store multiple CSV files originating from different reports, such as the Acute Discharge Situation Report, Discharge-Ready Date Report and Bed Availability and Occupancy Data, spanning across multiple months. Second, by linking data across multiple monthly reports, the performed analysis allows the identification of trends, bottlenecks, and seasonal fluctuations that otherwise would not be visible in short-term analysis. Third, the report combines descriptive analysis with contextual interpretation showing how hospital operations, processes, workforce capacity, and social care can affect patient flow and delayed discharges. Lastly, this report contributes with local actionable insights that can be used to create intelligence that supports decisions on patient discharges and bed utilisation policies.

Based on the findings of this study, several next steps should be considered. First, a joint discharge taskforce should be created to strengthen coordination between hospital operations, therapy teams, local authorities, and social care in order to review pathways and unblock delays. The goal should be to reduce the number of patients waiting more than 14 days after being declared ready for discharge. Second, a real time dashboard should be developed to monitor discharge-ready patients, reasons for delay, and averages days delayed in real time. This would allow the identification of bottlenecks early in the process of discharge and improve accountability across wards. Third, community and social-care capacity should be strengthened. Norfolk and Norwich NHS Trust, the Norfolk and Waveney Integrated Care Board, care homes, and local authorities should join efforts and focus on increasing care-home and community bed capacity in high-demand pathways.  Fourth, implement a digital referral and tracking system to improve the communication between hospital discharge teams, care homes, and local authorities. This would improve communication between hospitals and care homes, reduce deduplications, and increase visibility of available care-home vacancies. Fifth hospital-process-related delays should be reduced through operational improvements. This includes increasing transport availability at peak discharge hours, creating daily targets for medical reviews, and using a digital tracking system to monitor discharge-related processes. Lastly, complement quantitative data with staff, patient and focus group interviews to understand local factors that may affect discharge times, such as communication, documentation practices, or care coordination.
